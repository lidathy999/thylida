            Hello again! Thanks for scrolling this far! 🤗 Just a heads up, my
            portfolio is a little outdated at the moment. I haven’t had time to
            update it, but I’m keeping it up for now, and I hope it gives you
            some inspiration!

            Other than coding, I spend most of my free time playing Animal
            Crossing (add me!) or any other video games. 🤓 I've also been
            trying to read more so feel free to reach out to me with any book
            recommendations!
