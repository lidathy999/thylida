            Hello again! Thanks for scrolling this far! ðŸ¤— Just a heads up, my
            portfolio is a little outdated at the moment. I havenâ€™t had time to
            update it, but Iâ€™m keeping it up for now, and I hope it gives you
            some inspiration!
          </div>

            Other than coding, I spend most of my free time playing Animal
            Crossing (add me!) or any other video games. ðŸ¤“ I've also been
            trying to read more so feel free to reach out to me with any book
            recommendations!
